# Wolfenstein3D-style Software Renderer

**Wolfenstein3D-style software Renderer using Raycasting, written in C with SDL2.**

---

This is my **first attempt** at a software Renderer.  

So far we have:

- Basic walls and textures  
- Guns with animations and sound effects  

It performs quite well since I’m using **upscaling**.  

It’s a **heavy work in progress** with plenty of features to come, like a **level editor, enemies, etc.**

To build, you need **SDL2**, **SDL2_image**, and **SDL2_mixer**.  
I’ll improve the building process when I have the time.
